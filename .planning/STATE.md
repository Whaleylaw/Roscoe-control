# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18 — Milestone v1.2 initialized)

**Core value:** When I click into a project, I see everything about that project and can manage all its work from one place, including driving it through its GSD lifecycle, and autonomous agents pick up assigned work, execute it in isolated containers, and move it through the Kanban.
**Current focus:** v1.2 milestone — recipe-based ephemeral agent runtime. Design spec committed at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-recipe-agent-system-design.md`. Roadmap drafted (Phases 11–17). Next: `/gsd:plan-phase 11` for Runtime Foundation (DB migrations + model registry + auth principals).

## Current Position

Phase: 11 (Runtime Foundation) — Wave 1 COMPLETE
Plan: All four Wave-1 plans complete. 11-01 (model registry + task-override validation), 11-02 (runner-secret + runner principal), 11-03 (migrations), 11-04 (runner-token principal + requireRunnerToken wrapper + atomic revocation)
Status: 4/4 Wave-1 plans committed (11-01 d6b53ca, 11-02 f95b72e/94b3ff2, 11-03 e8594e7/53e4809, 11-04 bdbd9f5/01ba0e6/c3b10c3); RAUTH-01..06 all shipped
Last activity: 2026-04-19 — Plan 11-04 complete (RAUTH-02..06: runner-token module + requireRunnerToken wrapper + atomic revocation; 62 new Vitest cases; Phase 11 Wave 1 is now fully complete)
Next: Phase 12 (recipe indexer) — consumes recipes table from Plan 11-03

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2 roadmap]: Derived 7 phases (11–17) from 72 v1.2 REQ-IDs using dependency boundaries — Foundation (schema + registry + auth) → Recipe System → Task Runtime Context → Runner & Container → Checkpoints & Scheduler → UI Surfaces → Integration Testing
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Phase 11 deliberately scoped to substrate only (migrations + model registry + auth principals) because every later phase depends on it; no runtime code in Phase 11 to keep the foundation shippable as a pure additive migration
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Model-registry validation split across three phases — registry module + task-override validation land in Phase 11 (MODEL-01, MODEL-03), recipe-index-time validation in Phase 12 (MODEL-02), claim-time model resolution (`task.model_override ?? recipe.model.primary`) in Phase 14 (MODEL-04) — each lands where its consumer code lives
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Runner daemon + container execution + worktree lifecycle + `.mc/` seeding + reference image all ship together in Phase 14 because they are mutually dependent — the daemon is not useful without the worktree layout, and the worktree layout is not observable without a container
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Checkpoints and scheduler hooks grouped into Phase 15 because the checkpoint API needs runner-tokens (Phase 11), the runner code path emitting checkpoints (Phase 14), and the scheduler emits the same `task.runner_requested` events that drive claim — the three surfaces are the glue that makes the system reactive
- [v1.2 roadmap]: UI isolated to Phase 16 (and all UI REQs — RUI-01..06 — land there) so the runtime can be shipped and exercised via CLI/MCP/curl before the visual layer is built; matches v1.0/v1.1 precedent of UI-phase separation
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Integration testing capped the milestone in Phase 17 to avoid scope pollution — unit tests for sharp-edge pieces live with each phase during execution, but the reference-image pipeline test, crash-recovery test, and Playwright E2E all depend on Phases 11–16 being fully wired
- Recent phases (09/10) already logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table; not duplicated here
- [Phase 11]: Migration IDs renumbered 054-057 (not 036-039 as plan specified) because migrations[] already extends through 053_gsd_hierarchy_foundation; downstream plans must reference the actual applied IDs
- [Phase 11]: task_runner_tokens and task_checkpoints do NOT carry workspace_id/tenant_id columns — scoping flows through the parent tasks row and FK CASCADE handles cleanup; Plan 11-04 enforces task-to-workspace scoping at the auth layer
- [Phase 11]: runner_attempts is the only new tasks column with a non-null default (INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0); all other runtime fields (recipe_slug, model_override, container_id, runner_started_at, runner_exit_code, worktree_path, runner_max_attempts, runner_last_failure_reason, workspace_source, read_only_mounts, extra_skills) are nullable — downstream code must handle NULL
- [Phase 11-runtime-foundation-v1-2]: Model registry is code-seeded immutable const — no override file, no alias map, adding a model = a PR
- [Phase 11-runtime-foundation-v1-2]: Zod v4 uses { error: (issue) => ... } for dynamic refine messages — the v3 function-form was removed
- [Phase 11-02 / RAUTH-01]: Runner principal uses id=-1000 sentinel — outside both 1..N user range AND -agent_id range (agent API keys); Phase 14 claim-route code can dispatch on `user.id === -1000` without string-comparing username
- [Phase 11-02 / RAUTH-01]: Runner role = 'operator' not 'admin' — write access for checkpoints/claim (Phase 14/15) but NOT superuser; matches RAUTH-01 principle of least privilege
- [Phase 11-02 / RAUTH-01]: Path-scope gate (url.pathname.startsWith('/api/runner/')) is the SOLE check that ever compares a bearer against the runner secret; falls through on mismatch so session cookies and (Plan 11-04) runner-tokens can still resolve on runner paths
- [Phase 11-02 / RAUTH-01]: extractApiKeyFromHeaders is the shared bearer extractor — Plan 11-04 must reuse, do not fork
- [Phase 11-04]: Cross-task 403 enforced in requireRunnerToken wrapper, NOT in getUserFromRequest — concentrates 401-vs-403 decision in one place; route handlers MUST use wrapper
- [Phase 11-04]: Runner-token principal uses id=-2000 sentinel — distinct from -1000 (runner-secret) and -agent_id (agent keys); Phase 14/15 can dispatch on user.id === -2000
- [Phase 11-04]: Atomic revocation on terminal task transitions (done/failed/cancelled) wrapped in SAME db.transaction as status UPDATE — no sweeper, no lazy-on-reuse; crash rolls BOTH back
- [Phase 11-04]: runner_token_task_id populated in BOTH getUserFromRequest branch AND requireRunnerToken wrapper — downstream handlers cross-check as defense-in-depth
- [Phase 11-04]: Strict <= expiry rejection in verifyRunnerToken so a token cannot be used AT its exact expiry moment — guards against clock-skew

### Pending Todos

- Run `/gsd:plan-phase 11` to produce the Runtime Foundation plan (DB migrations + model registry + auth principals).
- Decide disposition of untracked session-send API experiments before Phase 14 runner work begins (`src/app/api/sessions/send/route.ts`, `src/app/api/sessions/hermes/send/route.ts`).
- Confirm the runner-token expiry calculation (`runner_started_at + recipe.timeout_seconds + 60s`) against the spec during Phase 11 planning so the column types in migration and the auth-layer arithmetic stay in sync.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No active blockers for v1.2 foundation planning.
- Reference image (`mc-hello-world-agent`) must be built and available in the local Docker daemon by Phase 14 — if the image author hasn't landed it by then, Phase 14 will block on its arrival.
- Docker is a hard runtime dependency for Phase 14; no substitute path is planned. Any operator environments without Docker will be unable to exercise the runner and will need to wait for v2 alternatives.
