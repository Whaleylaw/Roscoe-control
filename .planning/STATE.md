## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Full takeover view (not drawer/sidebar) — pending confirmation
- Breadcrumb navigation — pending confirmation
- All sub-views in v1 (tasks, sessions, agents, settings) — pending confirmation
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Used it.todo() stubs for wave-0 test scaffolds so suite stays green before implementation
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Used migration ID 051 instead of 050 (050 already taken by mcp_call_receipt_signing)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: URL-driven workspace state via React context (no Zustand for routing per FOUN-01)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Default view is dashboard when no view segment in URL
- [Phase 02]: Continued wave-0 it.todo() pattern from Phase 1 for consistent test scaffolding
- [Phase 02]: Used nested i18n structure matching existing locale file patterns
- [Phase 02]: Projects breadcrumb navigates to / (overview) since no /projects panel exists
- [Phase 02]: WorkspaceContent as inner component for context access inside provider
